David's Idea
REMEMBER GUYS, THIS APP CAN BE 99% DONE WITH PYTHON!!!!
App for caregivers. Some apps exist, but they are expensive and hard to use. This app would give you push notifications for reminders, fall notifications to family members if the person falls, connection to health wearables, and 
checking if a medicine tha thte user is taking is recalled. 

Here are some API's we would use:
I was going to use google fit and healthkit for apis, becuase it would need to be different for different devices. but flutter does cross platform data analytics, and supports python. 

Flutter for HealthKit and Health Connect:
  Use health package (https://pub.dev/packages/health, free) to access HealthKit (iOS) and Health Connect (Android) for health data 
  Handles platform differences
  Free for development/testing
  Test on Xcode simulators (iOS) or Android Studio emulators (free).
  Send data to Python server ( whats cool is that flutter can accses the gyroscopes in the phones to tell wheather someone fell)
Metriport API:
  Open-source health data API.
  Connects EHRs, wearables, networks like CommonWell.
  Free tier just download on ours; Python SDK available.
   https://docs.metriport.com/medical-api/getting-started/quickstart
OpenFDA API:
  Public FDA API for drug, device, food data.
  could be used for adverse events, recalls, labels, NDC.
  Free with raw data downloads.
  Python access via requests (JSON-based).
  https://open.fda.gov/apis/
Twilio API:
  Cloud platform for SMS, voice, video, email, WhatsApp(notifications for when person falls)
  Used for notifications, automated calls.
  Free trial credits 
  Python SDK available.
  https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api
OneSignal API:
  Omnichannel platform for push, in-app, SMS, email.
  Free tier with unlimited API calls.
  Supports automation for apps and websites.
  there is python sdk
  https://documentation.onesignal.com/reference/rest-api-overview
Google Calendar API:
  RESTful API for calendars, events, access rules.
  Free. there are 2 types of quotas. one is per minute per project, and the other is per minute per project per user
  Python SDK: google-api-python-client.
  https://developers.google.com/calendar/api/guides/overview
Firebase:
  can be used for authentication, Firestore database, storage, hosting.
  Free for small-scale apps
  Python sdk available  Supports real-time data sync.
  https://firebase.google.com/docs/admin/setup#python


work division:
person 1) 
  do UI and intigrate health package to get accses to health data

person 2,more experience(so ammaar)) 
  more experience, so will handle python backend(server)
  intergrate metriport(this will be self hosted, so will be non server. will use flask[ i know what the fuck it is nikhil])
  intergrate firebase(which will be the data collection and authentication)
  intergrate openFDA

Person 3) notifications
  intigrate twilo for sms
  onesignal for push
  alert logic in backend(like if the phone falls at more than 9.8 meters per second, send automated sms or somehting like that)

Person 4)
  intergrate google calendar
  in charge of testing 
 also helps intigrate health package to get accses to health data
